Initialize a git repository locally:
Git init
Git remote add origin <URL>
Git pull origin master
git fetch --all   # get all branches

Switch Branches:
Git checkout <branch name>

Check Status: 
git status       # if something was changed and it isn't tracking it it will be in red

Check Branches: 
git branch

In Whatever Branch you are in:
To upload to remote: DO this everytime
Git add <file needed>    # this allows you to tell which file you want to start keeping track of
Git commit -m <Insert a message about what you basically changed and which files you did it to> #puts into the github local repository to start keeping track of your added files 
OR YOU CAN ALSO
Git commit  and a message box appears for you to enter
Git push origin <branch (master, Hayden, yours)> 

Whenever you log on:
-	Always make sure you are using your branch and everything up to date by pulling from your branch or master
Git pull origin <branch wanted> 

Security Login Command needed before pushing or pulling:
 git config --global user.email 
 git config --global user.name 

Again: make sure  you always push before closing to your branch CHECKOUT TO YOUR BRANCH and pull when starting a new

To remove the last commit from git, you can simply run git reset --hard HEAD^ If you are removing multiple commits from the top, you can run git reset --hard HEAD~2 to remove the last two commits. You can increase the number to remove even more commits.
